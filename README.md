## About Me

I’m a **Full-Stack MERN Developer** working on real, production-grade platforms — not demos or tutorials.

I currently **lead development** of a fully dynamic e-commerce marketplace where *every page is data-driven*, SEO-optimized, and performance-focused.

- Lead developer on a live product with real users and payments
- Own features end-to-end: frontend, backend, SEO, performance, and infra
- Comfortable making architectural decisions and handling scale-related tradeoffs
- Focused on maintainable systems, not quick hacks
